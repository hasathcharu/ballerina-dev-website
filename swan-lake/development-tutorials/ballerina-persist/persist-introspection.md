intro: Bal persist can work with existing databases by providing the facility to introspect an existing database to 
 generate the persist model definition.

Introspection lets you use `bal persist` with existing databases without having to write a 
model definition file. Currently, introspection is only supported for MySQL databases and new data stores will be supported 
in the future. [Advanced SQL annotations](/learn/persist-model/#advanced-sql-annotations) are used to annotate names, special types, declare generated fields, custom foreign 
keys and indexes etc. 

During introspection, all table and column names which does not conform to the [Ballerina naming conventions](https://learn-ballerina.github.io/best_practices/naming_conventions.html#objects-and-records) will be converted to conforming names and their original names will be mapped with the [`@sql:Name`](/learn/persist-model/#mapping-names-with-name-annotation) annotation.

## Type Mapping

The below table shows how SQL types are mapped into Ballerina types. Development efforts are underway to support more SQL types.

The types that are partially supported will be fully supported later along with new annotations to better represent their specific SQL types. However, they can still be
used in queries. The unsupported types will also be supported in the future.

## Limitations

- Introspection currently supports only for MySQL data stores
- Cross-referring relations, where foreign keys are found in both sides of a couple of associated entities are not supported
- Foreign keys occurring from unique keys are not supported
- Some data types are unsupported, in which case the client API for those entities are not generated. However, you can still perform join queries that include those relations, without unsupported fields.
- Bal Persist only supports `auto-increment` generation strategy with the [`@sql:Generated`](/learn/persist-model/#declaring-generated-fields-with-generated-annotation) annotation
